myproject demonstrates the process of cleaning a real-world dataset by handling missing (null) values and removing outliers. The dataset initially contained randomly scattered null values across multiple columns, as well as extreme outliers in numerical fields such as age, salary, and performance scores. Using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, null values were either removed or imputed based on the context, while outliers were detected using statistical techniques and corrected to maintain data quality. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis or machine learning applications, ensuring that it is both consistent and reliable.
